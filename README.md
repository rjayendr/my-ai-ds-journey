🧠 AI Automation Architect Journey

Welcome to my personal learning and project repository, documenting my 20-week intensive journey to transition from 14+ years in automation to an AI Automation Architect. This repository serves as a living portfolio, showcasing my hands-on skills, practical projects, and continuous learning in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and MLOps.
🎯 Journey Purpose & Goals

My objective is to acquire and demonstrate deep expertise in building, deploying, and managing AI-powered automation solutions. This journey is structured to:

    Build a Strong Foundation: Master core Python, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.

    Develop Practical AI/ML Skills: Implement classical machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI models.

    Specialize in AI Agents: Design and build intelligent agents using LLMs and orchestration frameworks like LangChain.

    Master MLOps & Cloud Infrastructure: Learn to containerize, deploy, monitor, and manage AI solutions in cloud environments using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

    Create a Robust Portfolio: Showcase over 40 hands-on projects and 3 major capstone projects, demonstrating end-to-end AI automation capabilities.

📅 Roadmap & Timeline

This journey is structured into 4 distinct phases over 20 weeks, culminating in a comprehensive AI-Powered Business Process Automation Platform.

📚 Learning Strategy & Resources

My learning approach emphasizes 80% hands-on practice and 20% theoretical understanding. I leverage a hybrid resource strategy to maximize learning efficiency, practical application, and professional certification:

    Core Python: Udemy - "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" (Dr. Angela Yu) (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

    Advanced AI/ML & MLOps: Strategic use of Coursera Plus for Professional Certificates from IBM (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer), DeepLearning.AI (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice), Microsoft (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-ai-and-ml-engineering), and HashiCorp (https://www.coursera.org/learn/exam-prep-hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003).

For a detailed breakdown of all courses, certifications, and learning platforms, refer to my comprehensive roadmap document.
🚀 Quick Start for Reviewers

To explore this repository and run the projects:

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/rjayendr/my-ai-ds-journey.git
    cd my-ai-ds-journey

    Set up Virtual Environment (Recommended):

    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Git Bash/Linux/macOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    Install Dependencies:

        Navigate into a specific project folder (e.g., Weeks/Week_01_Python_Fundamentals/Project_01_Env_Setup/).

        Install its dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

    Explore Projects: Navigate to specific Weeks/Week_XX_*/Project_YY_* folders to find project code, README.md files, and setup_notes.md.
