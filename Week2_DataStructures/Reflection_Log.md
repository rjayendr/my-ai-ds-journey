## Week 2 Reflections:

**Day 8 (YYYY-MM-DD):**
* **Learned:** [Begin your Week 2 reflections here, e.g., "Started with NumPy, understanding array creation and basic operations."]
* **Struggled with:** [e.g., "Getting used to vectorized operations vs. traditional loops."]
* **Key Takeaway:** [e.g., "NumPy is incredibly powerful for numerical computations."]

## Week 1 Summary (from previous log):

* **Python Refresher:** I completed the Udacity Introduction to Python course (UD1110). While initially recommended to skip, this course proved to be a very helpful and thorough refresher for my Python basics, which was essential for me to feel confident moving forward.
* **Local Environment Setup:** Successfully set up Python in VS Code on my local machine, which is ready for hands-on coding practice.
* **Coding Platform Registration:** Registered accounts on HackerRank and LeetCode, and managed to solve one or two initial problems to get a feel for the platforms.
* **GitHub Account Creation:** Created my GitHub account, which is the first step towards building my public portfolio.
