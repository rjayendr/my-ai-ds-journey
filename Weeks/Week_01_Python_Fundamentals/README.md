## 💡 Weekly Insights & Reflections

> This week reinforced the importance of a **structured local environment**. Setting up tools properly has already saved hours of rework.  
> The hands-on projects proved essential in applying core concepts — I now have a stronger grip on Python’s data model and can structure simple CLI applications with confidence.
