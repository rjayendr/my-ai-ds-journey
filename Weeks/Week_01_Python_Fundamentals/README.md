üìÖ Week 01: Python Fundamentals & Environment Setup

Welcome to Week 1 of my AI Automation Architect journey! This week is dedicated to solidifying my Python fundamentals, establishing a robust development environment, and tackling initial hands-on coding challenges.
üéØ Weekly Objectives

    Environment Mastery: Ensure VS Code, Git, and Python virtual environments are perfectly configured for seamless development.

    Python Core Fluency: Rebuild and strengthen understanding of basic Python syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.

    Problem-Solving Foundation: Begin applying Python skills to solve practical coding problems.

    Project-Based Learning: Complete foundational projects that reinforce theoretical concepts.

üõ†Ô∏è Projects & Key Learnings

This week's projects are designed to build a strong base:

    Project 01: Personal Coding Environment Setup

        Focus: Setting up VS Code, Git, and virtual environments.

        Learnings: Importance of environment isolation, Git workflow, dependency management.
