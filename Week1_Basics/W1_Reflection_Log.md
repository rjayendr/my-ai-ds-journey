# Week 1 Reflection Log - Summary

This log summarizes my key activities, learnings, and challenges during Week 1 of my AI & Data Science journey.

---

## Key Activities & Progress:

* **Python Refresher:** I completed the Udacity Introduction to Python course (UD1110). While initially recommended to skip, this course proved to be a very helpful and thorough refresher for my Python basics, which was essential for me to feel confident moving forward.
* **Local Environment Setup:** Successfully set up Python in VS Code on my local machine, which is ready for hands-on coding practice.
* **Coding Platform Registration:** Registered accounts on HackerRank and LeetCode, and managed to solve one or two initial problems to get a feel for the platforms.
* **GitHub Account Creation:** Created my GitHub account, which is the first step towards building my public portfolio.

## Learnings & Takeaways:

* **Python Fundamentals:** I've successfully refreshed my understanding of Python basics, which was a critical step for me. I now feel much more comfortable with the core syntax, data types, and control flow.
* **Importance of Basics:** Re-engaging with the fundamentals was a valuable investment of time, despite initial thoughts of skipping. It provided a solid foundation.
* **Problem-Solving Start:** The initial attempts at HackerRank/LeetCode problems highlighted the need for consistent practice in algorithmic thinking.

## Challenges Faced:

* **Initial Overwhelm:** Felt a bit overwhelmed with the various setup tasks and deciding where to start.
* **GitHub Repository Creation:** The public repository itself is not yet created, which is the next immediate step to get my work online.
* **Integrating Tools:** The process of setting up and linking all the tools (VS Code, HackerRank, GitHub, Notion) required some initial navigation.

**Next Immediate Action:** Create the public GitHub repository and push this `W1_Reflection_Log.md` file along with any Python practice files.
